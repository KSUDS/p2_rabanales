# This code parses data from the CDC's Multiple Cause of Death datafile for FiveThirtyEight's 
# "Gun Death in America" project.
# This code produces clean dataframes of firearm deaths and suicides (firearm and non-firearm).
# Code to further process this data for our interactive graphic can be found in the 'interactive_prep.R' file
# elsewhere in this repo.

# All data is from the CDC's Multiple Cause of Death datafile.
# Data: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/VitalStatsOnline.htm#Mortality_Multiple
# Codebook: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/dvs/Record_Layout_2014.pdf

# Most of these calculations can be checked through CDC's two web tools:
# Wonder search: http://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D76
# WISQARS search: http://webappa.cdc.gov/sasweb/ncipc/mortrate10_us.html (1999-2014)

# We'll combine these into a single data frame.
# In keeping with CDC practice, we'll eliminate deaths of non-U.S. residents
