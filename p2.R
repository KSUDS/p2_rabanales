#The FiveThirtyEight data is a bit old, and our client would like us to use the
#most recent data from the CDC. He would also like the parser script to use 
#Python instead of R.

#While their visualizations focused on yearly averages, our client wants to create
#commercials that help reduce gun deaths in the US. They would like to target the 
#commercials in different seasons of the year (think month variable) to audiences 
#that could significantly reduce gun deaths. Our challenge is to summarize and 
#visualize seasonal trends across the other variables in these data.

# The goals:
  ####PYTHON TRANSLATION
#1. Translate FiveThirtyEight's CDC_parser.R script into a Python script.
#2.  Verify that your output matches their results.
#3. Build new data sets that use data through 2019.
#Client needs (charts and munging done in Python and R)


#1. Provide a brief summary of the FiveThirtyEight article.
#   a.Create one plot that provides similar insight to their visualization in the article. It does not have to look like theirs.
#   b.Write a short paragraph summarizing their article.
#2. Address the client's need for emphasis areas of their commercials for different seasons of the year.
#   a. Provide plots that help them know the different potential groups (variables) they could address in different seasons (2-4 visualizations seem necessary).
#   b. Write a short paragraph describing each image.
