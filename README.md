# Project 2: Reducing Gun Deaths (FiveThirtyEight) 

## Background 

The world is a dangerous place.  During 2015 and 2016, there was a lot of discussion in the [news about police shootings](http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/controversial-police-shootings/).  [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/) reported on [gun deaths in 2016](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-deaths/).  As leaders in data journalism, they have posted a clean version of this data in their Github repo called [full_data.csv](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data) for us to use. 

The FiveThirtyEight data is a bit old, and our client would like us to use the [most recent data from the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/VitalStatsOnline.htm#Mortality_Multiple).  He would also like the [parser script to use Python instead of R](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data/blob/master/CDC_parser.R
).

While their visualizations focused on yearly averages, our client wants to create commercials that help reduce gun deaths in the US.  They would like to target the commercials in different seasons of the year (think month variable) to audiences that could significantly reduce gun deaths. Our challenge is to summarize and visualize seasonal trends across the other variables in these data.

## Tasks

### Python translation

- [x] Translate [FiveThirtyEight's CDC_parser.R script](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data/blob/master/CDC_parser.R) into a Python script.
- [x] Verify that your output matches their results.
- [x] Build new data sets that use data through 2019.

### Client needs (charts and munging done in Python and R)

- [x] Provide a brief summary of the [FiveThirtyEight article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-deaths/).
    - [x] Create one plot that provides similar insight to their visualization in the article. It does not have to look like theirs.
    - [x] Write a short paragraph summarizing their article.
- [ ] Address the client's need for emphasis areas of their commercials for different seasons of the year.
    - [x] Provide plots that help them know the different potential groups (variables) they could address in different seasons (2-4 visualizations seem necessary).
    - [x] Write a short paragraph describing each image.


- Article Summary
The article is based off the annual gun death in America. The data collect from the Center of Disease Control and Preventionâ€™s Mulitple Cause of Death database. All data is collect from the 50 states from 2012-2014. Each intent is identify as suicide, homocide, accidental, or undetermined. Other variablaes are age, sex, enthicity, race, education, and home. They used different databases to determine the mass shooting, police officers shooting, and terrorism.


- Graph 1
In graph 1 is a line graph visual of the total of suicides by race, enthinicity, and gender from the twelve months of the following years 2012, 2013, and 2014. From the ages of 0-17, 18-24, 25-44, 45-64,
65+. The highest rate of suicides are in the age group between 45-64 and the lowest group 0-17. In 2012 the highest suicides were in the month of May with the ages between 45-64.

- Graph 2 
In graph 2 is a line graph visual with the numbers of suicides by race,ethnicity,and age 
from the year 2012-2014, separate by gender. As we can see White males and females
have higher numbers of suicides, leading next to Blacks and Hispanics, and last
to be Native American/Native Alaskan and Asian/Pacific Islander. Males have a 
higher rate of suicides than females. 

- Graph 3 
In graph 3 is a side by side barchart representing homocides by race.
